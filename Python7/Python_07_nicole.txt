Nicole by Shel Silverstein

Nicole loves me,
Nicole cares,
Nicole picks me peaches and pears.
Nicole offers me candy and Cokes,
Nicole listens and laughs at me jokes.
Nicole helps when I get in a fight,
Nicole does all my homework at night.
Nicole misses me,
Nicole cries,
Nicole thinks I'm a wonderful guy.
So if you ask me who's my best friend, in a whiz,
I'll stand up and tell you that Nicole is.
But yesterday night I got quite a scare,
I woke up and Nicole just wasn't there.
I called out and reached out for Nicole's hand,
In the darkness where Nicole usually stands.
Then I poked through the house, in each cranny and nook,
But I found somebody each place that I looked.
I searched till I'm tired, and now with the dawn,
There's no doubt about it-
Nicole's gone!
